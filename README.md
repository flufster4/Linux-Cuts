A simple shortcut manager for unix systems.

## Errors
If you get ANY errors make sure that you ran 'sudo make pkg' and have installed make by running 'sudo apt install make'. If you get any errors after running 'sudo make pkg' make sure you downloaded all the files: main.c, icon.png, makefile, and shortcut.xml. If any of the files are missing please redownload the zip file. If you encounter any internal errors please submit error report via Issues tab.
